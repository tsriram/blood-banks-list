# blood-banks-list
Simple React app to display list of bloodbanks in India

## How to run locally?

Clone this repo, make changes to JS/SCSS and run `webpack` to generate dist files (yet to write a dev config for webpack).

For testing, you can run a simple webserver (like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) from dist and access localhost, which should open index.html and render the React app. It currently loads JSON data through rawgit.
